\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5in]
  \setlength\itemsep{0.00em}
\item Work in progress. Developing a website to compete with
  \href{https://deepdreamgenerator.com}{Deep Dream Generator}. We are adding
  functionality of purchasing generated art on a canvas with Printify integration.
\item Developing backend with Google Cloud Platform, Firebase, and Node.js. Frontend is in React.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{NeuroTech Dashboard Team \hfill 2020}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5in]
  \setlength\itemsep{0.00em}
\item Goal of the project is to built a forearm band that can predict which keys a
  user is typing without the need for a keyboard. Non-invasive. Applications
  include augmented reality.
\item Developed a dashboard in React for visualizing realtime
  ML model predictions and signal data.
\item Developed a SocketIO server in Python for facilitating communication
  between ML model predictions and frontend applications written in React and Unity
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Age Prediction Via Methylation Data and Machine Learning \hfill 2019}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5in]
  \setlength\itemsep{0.00em}
  \item Developed a machine learning model in Keras for predicting a human's age based on a blood sample. Achieved 100\% accuracy $\pm$10 years and $>90\%$ accuracy $\pm$5 years.
  \item Developed a \href{https://epigenosys.com}{web interface} in Django that enables clients to interact with the machine learning model. Users can tune each of the 25 features and see how predicted age changes.
  \item Wrote a python notebook script for downloading and parsing raw methylation data from an \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE87571}{NIH database}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Libravos Co-Founder: Phone Insurance Made Better \hfill 2019}

\item Developed a mobile phone app in react-native that allows users to interact with a natural language processing ai chatbot powered by Rasa. \href{https://devpost.com/software/libravos-mobile-app-with-chat-bot}{Devpost}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Harvard Research Computing: Web and Database Intern \hfill 2019}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.5in]
  \setlength\itemsep{0.00em}
  \item Developed a web interface in Django that enables clients to view, request, or terminate their storage allocations remotely.
  \item Designed a mysql database model for tracking storage allocations and storage transactions.
  \item Used Python to create a command line interface for interacting with the novel database.
\end{itemize}
